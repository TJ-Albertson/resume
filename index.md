### CloudBox
CloudBox is an app I created to host and share files for my friends and family. It was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and is being hosted by myself in a Kubernetes cluster. It mainly uses Bootstrap for the UI and Auth0 for user authentication and authorization. The express server acts like a REST API to connect React to MongoDB and is also used to store the files.

### CloudBox
CloudBox is an app I created to host and share files for my friends and family. It was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and is being hosted by myself in a Kubernetes cluster. It mainly uses Bootstrap for the UI and Auth0 for user authentication and authorization. The express server is a RESTful API to connect React to MongoDB and is also used to store the files.

### My current job

I have been working working full-time for nearly 2 years at [CPU inc.](https://www.c-p-u.com/) as a Server/Computer technician. I setup and support servers and networking equipment for clients. These servers act as Domain Controllers, File Servers, Data backup servers, and SQL Databases. The networking equipment usually consist of IP based phone systems, Switches, and Routers which are set up with VLANs and VPNs based on the clients needs. When I am not assissting in the setup of servers and network equipment I am resolving support tickets for customers. We service many clients in and around Southeast Misouri (and a few remotely across the country), many of which have very large IT infrastructures.

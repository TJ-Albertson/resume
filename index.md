### CloudBox
CloudBox is an app I created to host and share files for my friends and family. It was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and is being hosted by myself in a Kubernetes cluster. It mainly uses Bootstrap for the UI and Auth0 for user authentication and authorization. The express server acts like a REST API to connect React to MongoDB and is also used to store the files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/TJ-Albertson/TJ-Albertson.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

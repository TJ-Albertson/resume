### CloudBox
CloudBox is an app I created to host and share files for my friends and family. It was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) and is being hosted by myself in a Kubernetes cluster. It mainly uses Bootstrap for the UI and Auth0 for user authentication and authorization. The express server acts like a REST API to connect React to MongoDB and is also used to store the files.

### My current job

I am currently working full-time at [CPU inc.](url) as tech person where I assist in the setup and support of servers and networking equipment for clients. These servers act as File Servers, Domain Controllers, and Data backup servers. The networking equipment usually consist of IP based phone systems, Switches, and Routers which are set up with VLANs and VPNs based on the clients needs. when I am not assissting in the setup of servers and network equipment I am resolving support tickets for customers. We service many clients in and around southeast misouri, many of which have very large IT infrastructures.

### What I want to do

I am interested in any kind of development. Although it is evident that I've steered towards Full Stack web development.

### Other technical knowledge  

I have a fair bit of knowledge about Java from personal projects I've done. Also C and C# from college courses.
I know a bit about computer components from building too many computers to count.
I have also gained a fair bit of knowledge regarding computer networks and networking equipment due to my current job. Topics that include:  
- IP Address and ports
- Routers and switches
- VPN's
- VLAN's
- Firewalls
- Azure Active Directory and domains
- Servers, reverse proxy's, load balancers
- NAS and SAN file storage + backup

### About Me  

I am 21 years old. I have spent most of my life in Southeast Missouri. I have been interested in computers and programming for a while. When I was younger I liked to make games and build computers for my friends. Some of my other hobbies/skills include soccer, snowboarding, and playing the flute. I really like watching movies and thats what I'm probably doing in my free time if I'm not playing league of legends.
